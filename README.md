# Digital-Image-Correlation
This folder contains a sample part of my thesis work in Southern Illinois University for my Master in Mechanical Engineering.
Matlab codes are mainly developed by senior research assistant at the time, Dr. Poudel, and is modified by me to accomodate my needs.
Matlab used to reate images from text files. Tet files were generated by ultrasonic scanning of samples.
Ncorr, a Matlab based application, used to analyze images before and after loading and came up with strain map.
